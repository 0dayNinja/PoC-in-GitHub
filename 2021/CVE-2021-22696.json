        "description": "PoC for exploiting CVE-2021-22696 : CXF supports (via JwtRequestCodeFilter) passing OAuth 2 parameters via a JWT token as opposed to query parameters (see: The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR)). Instead of sending a JWT token as a \"request\" parameter, the spec also supports specifying a URI from which to retrieve a JWT token from via the \"request_uri\" parameter. CXF was not validating the \"request_uri\" parameter (apart from ensuring it uses \"https) and was making a REST request to the parameter in the request to retrieve a token. This means that CXF was vulnerable to DDos attacks on the authorization server, as specified in section 10.4.1 of the spec. This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.3; Apache CXF versions prior to 3.3.10.",
